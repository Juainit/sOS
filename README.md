Social Operative System: The Use of Technology to develop New Forms of Governance
1. Introduction

The project is based on the research thesis in technologies to create new forms of government. Start with an argument that links the techniques (phisical technologies), which build up complexity, and the techniques of social organization (social technologies) to handle the new complexity. Under the axiom of technology over technology as a premise, the thesis infers that social technology also shares this premise; affirming that we can create a better technology of social organization based on current technical and scientific knowledge.


2. Context and problem

The formal institutional model is composed of a binomial: State and Markets, which, together with Civil Society - which gives legitimacy and the dynamic duo - shape the strong core, the source of progress and current wealth. The relationship between the elements of this institutional model is based on the balance of the institutions' own interests through power of influence. In other words: in a network of hierarchies, the interests of those who have the most capacity to influence prevail.
This balance, inherently, generates three externalities: sustainability, inefficiency, and inequality. That makes up a set of symptoms:
 
•	Polarization.
•	Political malpractice. 
•	Power the conflict.
•	Low risk control capacity.
 

And more visibly as:
 
•	Decreased confidence in the
•	democracy (populisms).
•	Increase in intra-extra state conflicts. (nationalisms).
•	Low efficiency capacity.
•	Low levels of happiness. 
•	Little ability to handle diversity
 

The thesis infers that these manifestations are symptoms that social organization techniques are in a phase of obsolescence (loss of efficiency/competitiveness) and the consequent loss of legitimacy because they can no longer provide an effective response to the existing complexity. The science and technology of tools has advanced through an exponential axiom: technology over technology, configuring a more complex society creating non-linear models, but the forms of the social organization follow a linear model established in the context of the 18th-19th centuries, designed under a scientific and technological knowledge very different from the one we have today, and which does not allow us to respond to the new complexities.


3. Objective

Creation and execution of an institutional model using current technological resources (tools + social) that allows managing complexity, minimizing externalities, and improving human progress.


4. Key Success Factors (KSF)

To achieve the objective, the model must:
•	Allow correct transferability, minimizing the social conflict characteristic of transitions.
•	Take into account the trajectory, the institutional model is articulated for a result defined as progress: Equality + (Heterogeneity / Consensus) + Freedom.
•	Be defined by two of the characteristics of technological improvement: efficiency and social empowerment.
•	Have an organizational and motivational infrastructure that can be sustained in time.
•	Establish synergies between bottom-up and top-down.


5. Model

The model is made up of three elements:
1.	Data Gathering Module (aka “The Pill”). It is a module dedicated to data collection, and -according to RGDP legislation-, applies the law enforcement for the pseudonymity, deletion, or transfer back of individual data. It is an Artificial Intelligence (AI) of legal application (law boot), which protects and manages the individual's data. It has an important component of individual freedom and social empowerment: since, on the one hand, the data has an attribute of veracity and legitimacy, and on the other, it is inferred that thanks to this data better decisions can be made, both at the individual level and collective level.
2.	Social Machine (SM). It is the module that allows decision-making, it is based on a three-dimensional model: 1) Physical dimension or GPS, 2) Virtual dimension, 3) Cognitive dimension. Through these, and comparing all the information in the data of all individuals, allows:
	Create regression models or predictive models. 
	Design ad-hoc policies. 
	Design pre-distributive policies. 
	Expand social scientific knowledge and better understand society and the individual. 
	Optimize the execution of common objectives.
3.	Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). It is the control module of the other modules. Technically it is an institution (software), a matrix on which the P2P form of government is developed between individuals and assets. An individual's relationship with the DAO is always established as an owner, being at the same time a client, worker, and investor. It is a hybrid model; it combines a human domain (nodes) and a machine domain (links). The human domain refers to smart contracts or tasks: 
 
	Propose
	Validate
	Execute
	Delegate
	Finance
	Save / compute
 
The machine domain refers to the relationships between the nodes, it is a label manager (AI) of the data ("The Pill"), it controls the relationship between the nodes through these tags and the smart contracts, thus allowing to find the best way to concatenate a chain of tasks, find who can best validate a task or control that outside interests do not interfere with the tasks. 

6. Features
The institutional model has the following attributes:
•	Minimizes the perversions of power inherent in a social structure. The relationship between the set of assets and the number of individuals configures the percentage of power for decision-making, the matrix avoids minority interest actions or buy-out practices. 
•	It has a transparent design for decisions, and a very large democratic component, in addition, it is agreed by this method:
o	The % of interest with which the tasks are financed. 
o	The % of the investments that are made.
•	It is very plastic, flexible, something essential for a correct transition. The smart contract “delegate” allows us to understand decentralization as a gradient, and not only in a dichotomous way.
•	Generates a parity between work and capital, the matrix equally computes assets that represent work and assets that represent capital (investment). It has no more power neither who performs task assets - tasks through smart contracts -, nor who finances said tasks, in any case, whoever has the greatest diversity of assets will have more power.
•	Allows greater efficiency. Establish P2P relationships, without an intermediary, through labels and smart contracts.
•	Maintains parity between tasks and financing.
•	Uses the cryptocurrency Euro, created by the European Central Bank.
•	Conforms to the gig-economy model and allows the individual -if he wishes- to auto-finance the product/service.
•	Adds legitimacy to the individual's data, has a longitudinal characteristic. 
•	The chain or sequence made up of the human domain plus the machine domain always allows the individual to control decisions. 
•	Conforms to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals: 10 (inequality), 16.5 (Corruption), 16.6 (transparent institutions), 16.7 (Representative Decision-Making), and 16.9 (Legal identity).
By reflecting on the relationship between collective intelligence and the ways of making better decisions (relationship between freedom, diversity, and consensus), it is important to point out one characteristic: Democracy starts from this relationship, and for this reason, it requires correct representation, at the same time as reliable information. Thus, the institutional model designed is shown as a form of assembly between nodes controlled by the artificial intelligence of each individual. In other words, if it is already difficult to hold an assembly among 10 individuals to make better decisions, it is more difficult to hold an assembly among 1000 individuals; because every time one more person is added, complexity is added exponentially. It cannot be expected that the 1000 people, - with different information - speak one by one in a cross way and reach a consensus. This is why we create representativeness - and by creating representativeness we gain efficiency, but we lose information -. The proposed model is conceptualized so that the artificial intelligence of an individual speaks with the other artificial intelligence of other individuals, and reaches consensus through the data of each one, in an environment controlled by smart contracts and labels.

7. Strategy
Institutional changes are preceded by technological changes, power transitions, where customary power dominates a technology. And the new power dominates a more efficient technology, which allows better management of the complexity already created, and establishes new limits of empowerment or social utility. It is the relationship between technology and democratization; theese are necessary elements, but not enough without a good strategy.
This has as its main characteristic that it starts with the individual. Not only because of the socio-liberal trajectory, nor the individualism that defines today's society. But due to the demographic pyramids in many European countries, proposing institutional changes to those over a certain age to make decisions through data carries the risk of non-acceptance. It carries the same risk as creating a political party from a technological nature, young people would be the target of that political party; But they do not have enough democratic strength, since they are a minority. 

That is why the strategy starts from the reverse: that the individual “see” and "test" for himself how data technology can help him make better decisions in his day to day life. If he sees that it is capable, then he can give the option to raise to a joint decision level (common decision level). In addition, the strategy takes into account the connotation between technology and the magic element inherent in the human being.



8. Product creation 

8.1 Solution to an individual problem 
According to the strategy, the rhetoric of the problem revolves around the following messages: 
•	The data is used to influence us more precise, and by the interests of third parties. 
•	The benefits of the data are for companies or States, not for us. 
•	There is a lack of control over who has your data. 
•	It is difficult to apply your privacy rights on your digital life, you accept cookies and that's it.

8.2 Features
So, the functionalities that answer the problem are:
 
•	Take control of your data.
•	Apply your rights to your data.
•	Manage your data safely.
•	Make decisions based on your data. 
•	Earn money with your data.
•	Earn money doing tasks.
 

In summary: It is a decentralized data bank, owned by its members, which maintains privacy, anonymity, and allows better decisions to be made based on the data of each individual.

8.3 Core system
Core system consists of:
•	Smartwatch with electro dermal activity sensor (EDA): Fitbit Sense, Apple Watch *.
•	The Pill App, is the set of the three modules DGM, Social Machine, and DAO.

The core system offers the functionalities described in the form of decentralized bureaucracy, decentralized ownership, and self-financing, the latter term is understood as having an effect on the monthly payment for the functionalities. The relationship of an individual with the product/service is always as an owner and client, and then, it comes from the use of the type of smart contract use. From the individual who wishes to have only a relationship as a "client", will be the one who only uses the smart contract "delegate"; to the individual who wishes to have a relationship as an investor -who uses the smart contract "finance"-. Even with the different conjunctions between smart contracts, the possibilities are abroad to ensure a sustainable economic ecosystem and the flexibility that allows subsistence.

8.4 The Marketplace
The core system conforms the institutional infrastructure and functionalities, but the application of those functionalities remains open to human inventiveness. Enabling third parties to create different decentralized applications (dApp) that enables the data to be used for various purposes on a remunerated basis. Here are different types of applications that can be created using the core system as an example. There are just a sample of the "match" algorithms but with a much larger variable (data) input:

•	Real State: Buying a home is an important moment for the individual (stress), the conditions when acquiring a property are 1) economic, 2) territory or area, 3) the attributes of the home, and 4) personal tastes. Currently, the real estate market establishes a series of parameters or filters for the search for a home through intermediaries (online and offline), and the buyer must visit various properties and choose. With the data from the Pill, their habits, the client can observe many more parameters that allow them to make a better decision when buying a home. Distance with friends and family, schools, services and gyms, savings in transport, levels of well-being, lifestyle, post-purchase economic level. In such a way that the dApp predicts what your “perfect” home will be (%).
•	Education: It allows adapting the contents and educational dynamics to each individual. With the core system, it is not only possible to detect cases of bullying, it can also be seen for each pupil which subjects present the greatest stress, which are the longest attention times and why, or how they manage frustration, among others.
•	Creation of teams: It enables the creation of teams for a specific objective. It is a functionality very similar to that used by the label system to find out who is the individual who can best perform a task. If a team or department needs to hire a person, the labels of those who make up the team and the labels of the person to be hired must match.
•	Political Party: It allows creating an organization for decentralized political decision-making.
The core system and the dApp ecosystem make up the sOS, social operative system.


9. What’s out there

No competitors have been found, but various initiatives can be highlighted:
•	Digi.me, a company that stores data and provides statistics on it, wants to create an ecosystem of apps to use them, but very few people use that platform. It is still a company with private interests, and that is a disadvantage when it comes to trusting them.
•	Longitools, an interuniversity initiative funded by H2020, collects exogenous data (environmental, noise, pollution), lifestyles, and health to determine risks of cardiovascular disease. It has a scientific purpose.
•	Moodfit, Sanvello, and Moodmission, are behavior managers, data entries are made manually. Sanvello has a strong community component. There’s huge scientific knowledge about the human psyche based on these Apps.
•	SingularityDAO decentralized investment environment, aimed to creating a form of decentralized computing.
•	Civic: A very good example of an identity manager application using blockchain, it is a clear example of the multiple possibilities offered by technology.
