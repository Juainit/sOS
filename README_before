Social Operative System (sOS): The Use of Technology to Develop New Forms of Governance.

Question and goal
How can we organize ourselves better for the new challenges humanity must face? How can we use current technologies to develop better forms of governance? The research vision and goals are aligned to improve SDG 3, SDG 4, SDG 5, SDG 8, SDG 9, SDG 10, SDG 11, SDG 12, SDG 13, SDG 16, and SDG 17.

Method
The research development employs exploratory, descriptive, and heuristic methodologies. The perspective is complex thinking, which utilizes recursivity, dialogic, and hologrammatic principles to understand contextual information and define the approach. The dissertation strongly emphasizes scientific values, especially the CUDO principles and the use of science to benefit society. As Norbert Wiener said, "Scientist as an entrepreneur", if we are social scientists, we are social entrepreneurs. The thesis aims to explore how to execute theory construction throughout the dissertation.

Argumentation
The research begins by examining the relationship between physical and social technologies. We develop physical and social technologies to control physical and social contexts (complexity). For instance, it is difficult to understand current democracy without printing; or capitalism without the metrics of machines and the energy transformation, because capital is a social technology -like States-. The analysis focuses, among others, on the relationship between the vector of power and technology; or the fall of civilizations, extracting common patterns. And finds dissonance between social and physical technologies, meaning that when physical or social technologies cannot respond to a complex context (conditioned by social and physical technologies), that civilization (social organization) falls. Social and physical technologies become obsolete because they cannot embrace the new complexity of the context. 
Complexity is a definitory attribute of societies and their relationship with the contexts nowadays. However, the technological tools to manage society and its relationship with the contexts are from the XVIII-XIX centuries. Nations, States, democracies, corporations, institutions, markets, debt, nationalism, socialism, and liberalism, among others, were all emancipatory and disruptive social technologies at their moment. They marked an explosion of interdependencies and new ways to organize society. And have been the main source of wealth and progress since then, thanks to them, humankind has reached current levels of development. However, paradoxically they are becoming more of a hindrance to progress nowadays, context complexity has changed.
The work delves into the exponential progress of humankind (technology over technology), defines the characteristics of technological emancipation, and realizes that emergent systems can better embrace complexity than centralized systems. Centralized systems are efficient and effective in low-complex contexts, but in highly complex environments, they are inefficient and lack efficacy. Decentralized systems are inefficient in low-complex environments but gain efficacy in high-complex contexts. Complex systems are non-linear, and current society is non-linear, but how we manage and organize society is linear.
Turning a non-emergent system, like human society, into an emergent one requires a new approach since humans have different rationalities, values, information, interests, localities, etc. The researcher hypothesizes using human data as the stigmergy element of an emergent system. This requires a new way to measure the individual and society since social sciences have the micro-macro gap measurement (micro and macro are different metrics, different approaches, but they explain the same). The research focuses on controlling interdependences since human progress results from negative/positive feedback. Negative feedback means what one wins is what the other loses (zero-sum games), and positive feedback means both wins. 

Therefore, the researcher conceptualized and designed a model (sOS) to encompass new complexity and progress; the thesis defines progress as the maximization of equalities + (ratio between diversity and consensus) + liberties. The way to measure individuals and society is through Frame Theory (longitudinal), and the human dynamics follows Homo Ludens Theory schema. 
The model is composed of four modules:
1)	Unique Individual Longitudinal Ledger (UILL) is a personal AI that gathers all data that the individual generates and applies GDRP regulation as erasing or pseudonymizing the data. Based on this, individuals can make better decisions and design ad-hoc policies (is the extrapolation of using AI to design media or a product but to policies).
2)	The hybrid model is based on human and machine domains. The human domain relates to human tasks or smart contracts: 1. Propose, 2. Validate, 3. Delegate, 4. Execute, 5. Finance. The machine domain is related to controlling interdependencies to accomplish tasks based on UILL data.
3)	Social Machine is the matrix where all UILLs compute and compare data between all individuals. It is a 3D model (1. Physical dimension. 2. Virtual dimension. 3. Cognitive dimension).
4)	Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) is the ownership and matrix control module. All members are workers, clients, investors, and always owners of the DAO.

Characteristics of the model
•	Shows that society is more than the sum of the individuals, but more importantly, it matters how the individuals are summed depending on how the interdependencies are managed. The thesis argues that this emergent structure has no bias problems like centralized AI structures.
•	Defines individual and social empowerment through data, with our data, we design better policies. 
•	Defines new ways to capture and use social capital, social capital is key to developing better policies.
•	The approach is self-organization (bottom-to-bottom) and enables to control risks better.
•	There is no more-educated AI than others, nor AI with more information than others, no different behaviors between them, and there is no AI with more power than others; there are no "inequalities" between AIs. It is an open information network with "complete" information.
•	Defines new limits to privacy and liberties, as privacy is validated between AIs. In other words, each AI controls the individual's privacy because all AIs keep and manage the individual’s data preserving her/his privacy thanks to smart contracts (consensus). There is no privacy between AI, there is data privacy between individuals.
•	Defines a decentralized framework regulation using smart contracts (human domain); this enables consensus between ad-hoc policies. Defines decentralized ownership.
•	Centralization implies redistribution, while decentralization implies pre-distribution.
•	Pre-distribution implies forecasting, individual and society are not determined, but it can be forecasted.

Status
Currently, I’m executing the dissertation, I did a test with DAO in 2020, however, instead of managing crypto assets, the DAO I did, managed material assets. After, I designed some buying and selling crypto bots, the benefits of these bots finance robotics education for kids in Casal La Verneda i La Pau, an unprivileged area in Barcelona. I’m evidencing that:
•	In a context of negative interdependence, such as the unregulated crypto market, technology (bots) allows us to revert from negative to positive interdependence. In such contexts, either a State or a foundation regulates or minimizes the negative externality. However, in this case, what investors lose/bots gain is directly invested in education (positive interdependence). This generates positive externality efficiently and effectively (without intermediaries).
•	The emerging action is "bottom-to-bottom": "bottom" has a problem, "bottom" develops and executes the solution, and does not require "top" (bottom-up implies centralization).
•	Emergence is self-governance, economic freedom equals governance freedom. An entity can be autonomous and not depend on other entities that exercise arbitrary power through economic control, whether public or private.
•	Emerging actions (emerging systems) encompass greater complexity than non-emerging. 
•	Technology tends to emancipate civil society, emancipates the individual and how they organize.
•	Social innovation tends towards emancipation, towards greater emergence. Emerging systems are more resilient than centralized ones.
•	The best way to embrace complexity is with complexity, not reducing complexity, and technology allows us to embrace greater complexity.
•	This opens the door to the discussion that there are other ways of managing resources than just through States and markets, or, public and private.
